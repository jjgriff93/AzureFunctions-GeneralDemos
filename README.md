# AzureFunctions-GeneralDemos
Several Azure Functions demoing different functionalities using HTTP Triggers.

This includes 
1. Parsing a JSON for a specific property
2. Parsing and replacing a property in a JSON
3. An example of a Cosmos DB Functions API, with the Create method. I will update this with other CRUD operations in future.

## Cosmos DB CRUD
To get started using the API, you will need to add your own Cosmos DB connection strings in the local.app.settings file for the Cosmos DB URI,
Key, Database name and Collection name. You can find these in the Azure portal in your Cosmos DB resource.
